Congrats! You've completed the workshop. Together we've deployed Strapi's FoodAdvisor demo to Platform.sh. From this point you can customize your application in additional development environments to deliver your own decoupled Strapi-powered site.

## Considerations

- Keeping your work: [setting up an integration](https://docs.platform.sh/integrations/source.html)
- Strapi development servers, and write access
- Editorial workflows and the flow of data on Platform.sh
